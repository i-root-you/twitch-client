# Twitch & OBS Client/Bot 
This will be a set of a few commands and a library for connecting the OBS system
with the newest v5 of the twitch API client. In addition, we will be providing
basic bot functionality, as a way to take input from the channel, and possibly
an webserver to provide either websockets to our clients or just a basic REST
API. 

## Sample Code

```Go
// Provide a go example of using this bot 
```
